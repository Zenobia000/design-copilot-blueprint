TRIZ parameters? (e.g., C1 improves P14 while C2 worsens P14). Record each conflict \
as a secondary contradiction with source set to the originating contradiction ID.

2. **Circular dependencies** — Detect chains where resolving C1 would worsen C2, \
resolving C2 would worsen C3, and resolving C3 would worsen C1. Any cycle of length \
≥ 2 counts. If found, set architecture_health to "circular".

3. **Severity amplification** — Identify combinations of contradictions whose \
simultaneous presence makes the problem space harder than the sum of parts \
(e.g., two major contradictions that share the same worsening parameter \
amplify to fatal-level difficulty).

4. **Coverage gaps** — Given the mission, constraints, and KPIs, are there critical \
engineering dimensions (thermal, structural, cost, safety, supply chain, regulatory) \
that NO existing contradiction addresses? Report each gap as a minor secondary \
contradiction.

   - Which TRIZ parameters does it IMPROVE? (from the contradiction it resolves)
   - Which TRIZ parameters may it WORSEN? (side-effects of its mechanism)
   - For each worsened parameter, check if it conflicts with any other contradiction's \
     improving_param or any constraint/KPI.

3. **Cross-alternative interference** — check if two alternatives' mechanisms \
require mutually exclusive physical states (e.g., one needs high rigidity, another \
needs flexibility in the same component).

4. **PC state conflict** — for contradictions of type PC, check if any alternative \
forces a state that contradicts the physical_contradiction's required dual state.
